# My Web Design Project - Implementing HTML Structure from Figma

Welcome to my Web Design Project! In this project, I will be implementing the HTML structure for a webpage based on a designer file available on Figma. This project focuses solely on creating the HTML structure, with no CSS or styling involved. It's all about semantic HTML.

## Project Details

- **Designer File:** [View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage)
- **Design Source:** [Download the Fig File](https://intranet.aluswe.com/rltoken/BOC4LSHhGgn-RudlXjuUKg)
- **Rounding Values:** I will feel free to round them as needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Designer File:** To get started, I will visit the Figma designer file by clicking [here](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage). If I don't have a Figma account, I can create one to access the design details.

2. **Download the Design Source:** I will download the Fig file from [this link](https://intranet.aluswe.com/rltoken/BOC4LSHhGgn-RudlXjuUKg) to have access to all design details.

## Implementation

In this project, I will implement the HTML structure for the webpage based on the design provided in the Figma designer file. I will focus on creating a semantic HTML structure that represents the various elements, sections, and content as accurately as possible.

## Additional Notes

- I will remember that this project is for creating the HTML structure only. There should be no CSS or styling involved at this stage.
- I will pay attention to any rounding of values as specified in the design source.
- I will ensure that I have the required fonts installed or accessible using the provided links.

## Project Completion

Once I've completed the HTML structure based on the designer file, I can further enhance the project by adding CSS and styling to match the design's appearance. This project serves as the foundation for my future design and development work.
