# My Web Design Project - Implementing HTML Structure from Figma

Welcome to my Web Design Project! In this project, I will be implementing the HTML structure for a webpage based on a designer file available on Figma. This project focuses solely on creating the HTML structure, with no CSS or styling involved. It's all about semantic HTML.

## Project Details

- **Designer File:** [View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-file-link)
- **Design Source:** Figma
- **Fonts:** I will make sure to have the fonts installed or access them here: [Source Sans Pro](link-to-source-sans-pro-font) and [Spin Cycle OT](link-to-spin-cycle-ot-font)
- **Rounding Values:** Some values in the designer file are in float; I will feel free to round them as needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Designer File:** To get started, I will visit the Figma designer file by clicking [here](https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-file-link). If I don't have a Figma account, I can create one to access the design details.

2. **Duplicate to My Drafts:** After accessing the designer file, I will duplicate it to my drafts. This step will allow me to access all the design details I need for my project.

## Implementation

In this project, I will implement the HTML structure for the webpage based on the design provided in the Figma designer file. I will focus on creating a semantic HTML structure that represents the various elements, sections, and content as accurately as possible.

## Additional Notes

- I will remember that this project is for creating the HTML structure only. There should be no CSS or styling involved at this stage.
- I will pay attention to any rounding of values as specified in the design source.
- I will ensure that I have the required fonts installed or accessible using the provided links.

## Project Completion

Once I've completed the HTML structure based on the designer file, I can further enhance the project by adding CSS and styling to match the design's appearance. This project serves as the foundation for my future design and development work.
